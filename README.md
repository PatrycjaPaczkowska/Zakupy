# Hello!

This is link to website: https://patrycjapaczkowska.github.io/Zakupy/
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Short Description
I created this site for my own needs. Apart from the usual decimal list I needed a list sorted by brackets. This option is called "Od motywatora" because I copy it directly from a pdf file with a diet from Dietary Motivator https://motywatordietetyczny.pl/. 

The application has only mobile version.
The data is saved to localStorage.
